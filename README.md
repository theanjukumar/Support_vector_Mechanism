# Support_vector_Mechanism
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well it's best suited for classification.
# PROJECT TITLE
Using the support vector algorithm of supervised Machine learning,predict "iris.csv" dataset to find out species or different
# TASK 1 :Preprocess the data in skitlearn library
# TASK 2:Load the data using sklearn model selecetion default argument
# TASK 3:On the basis of your data train_test_spilt your "SVM model"
# TASK 4:Implement the support vector mechanism classifer using svm_classifer ,thesvm must be "Linear"
# TASK 5:Train the classifer on the training data
# TASK 6:Find out the prediction value on the test data
# TASK 7:Test the model with help of accuracy,accuracy should be lie in the range of 0 to 1
# CONCLUSION
According to my support vector mechanism model the species are Linear.With the accuracy of "1.00" Hence proved model was successfully implemented
